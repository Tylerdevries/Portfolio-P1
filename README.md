# TDV Web Design
TDV Web Design is a landing page for new or existing Ecommerce businesses to solicit the services of a proffessional Ecommerce web designer.
The TDV Web Design landing page outlines the features that will be included in the finished design of a website, including Responsiveness and uniqueness.

Users of this site will be able to find all the information they need to know regarding the services of the web builder and how to contact them. 
The site is targeting towards business owners who are looking to have a unique and proffesionally designed webstore.

## Features:
### Navigation:
Featured at the top of the page, the navbar contains the name of the business (TDV Web Design) in the far left of the navbar.

Located in the top right are links to the three different sections of the page (Home, Features, Contact).

The navbar is in a font consistent with the page and a simple white color that fits the overall colour scheme of the site.

The navbar clearly portrays the name of the business and the links.

It is responsive, turning to a burger menu when the site is used on narrower screens to allow to site to be easily accessible to users from any device.

### The Header:

The header shows the name of the business and a short description of the services provided.

Here is where I first used a gradient I created in CSS. It goes from a dark navy to a light blue.

I used a copyright free image from unsplash.com. I used this image primarily because it fitted my colour scheme but it also somewhat represents the services of the business. 

I used two buttons titled Read More and Contact Me for an alternative route to the different sections of the page.

These buttons are in light blue and a deep green as I believe these soft colours suit the overall tone of the site.

### The Companies Section:

Here I display a list of companies from left to right.

This section is used to display companies the business may have worked with in the past to give the customer/ user a understanding as to the quality they may expect from TDV

I used companies that would immediately be familiar to the user.

This section is where I first used a CSS wave effect created through createwaves.io. I used this effect at the top and bottom of this section to create a nice effect and divison between the sections of the site.

### The Features Section:

The Features section gives a simple descripton of the features that will be implemented to the final design of a site built by TDV Web Design.

Here I used the same design philsophy as in the header, Using a stock photo that both matched the colour scheme and
